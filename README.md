# Regression-Notebook-

In this notebook, I started by analyzing the 'train' dataset and creating plots and histograms to explore the data. I then eliminated the null spaces in the dataset, converted the categorical columns to numerical ones ,looked if there were any outliers to exclude and dropped out the insignificant features. To generate an accurate prediction, I trained 4 regression models on the refined data. As my final model I used the Linear Regression Model since it gave superior predictions on my train test set.
